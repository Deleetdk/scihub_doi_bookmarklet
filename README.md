# What?
This is a bookarklet that makes it easy to nagigate to Sci-Hub from a page using the DOI identifier. A bookmarklet is like a normal bookmark but instead contains javascript code that performs an action of just a normal URL.

# Installation
1. Make a new bookmark in your browser.
2. Copy the source code from here into the location field of that bookmark.

# Use
When you're at a website about a paper with a DOI that you want to read, click the bookmarklet you created. If the script successfully detects a DOI, you will be taken to Sci-Hub to access the paper.
